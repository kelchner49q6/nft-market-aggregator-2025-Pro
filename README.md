## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how an NFT-market-aggregator would integrate with major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management.

It's important to first clarify a key distinction: **NFT-market-aggregators primarily deal with Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on blockchains like Ethereum and Solana, while exchanges like Binance and Coinbase primarily deal with fungible tokens (cryptocurrencies).**

Therefore, the integration is not for trading NFTs *on* these exchanges, but rather for managing the **fungible cryptocurrency assets** required to *participate* in the NFT ecosystem. The aggregator becomes a central dashboard that bridges the world of DeFi (Decentralized Finance, where NFTs live) and CeFi (Centralized Finance, where the major exchanges operate).

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how this integration works for automated trading and portfolio management.
